> [AraWord](http://aratools.catedu.es/araword/) is a part of [AraSuite](https://sourceforge.net/projects/arasuite/), a toolset for augmentative and adaptative communication, and this is it's mobile version AraWord mobile (**AWm**).

## Deployment

AWm is built on top of [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) version 1. So, to deploy the app you will need to install [npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm), ionic and cordova.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dicearr/araword-mobile
npm install -g ionic cordova
ionic start araword blank
```
Then you will have two folders one with an empty Ionic project and the other with the AWm source code. You have to move the content on the second one into the first one. Now the "araword" folder contains an Ionic project ready to be launched or built. At this point the source code folder can be removed.
